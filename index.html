				<div id="aboutme">
					<p>Namaste! My name is Akshata (Ak-shae-taa), and I’m from India. Currently, I'm a first-year PhD student in the program of Technical and Communication communication and Rhetoric at Texas Tech University. I recently received my masters degree in the same program from Auburn University, AL. This is a collection of samples of my work in editing, writing, design, and teaching. I have always enjoyed helping audiences by improving user experience of websites and enhancing documents by editing them for comprehensibility and visual appeal; thus I found my passion in communicating technical information to the world audiences. <br>Coming from a radically different culture and a country where technical communication is still in its incipient stage to a place where technical communication is in demand has intrigued me and opened my eyes to new perspectives in technical communication.
					Additionally, my being an outsider in this country has acclimated my mind to think from the perspective of a larger audience and to look at cultural nuances, thus allowing me to bring in an international focus to the field. As a result, my socio-cultural background and empirical knowledge make me well suited to be a technical communicator for a team that needs an outsider’s perspective, thus enabling me to make a valuable contribution to the field of technical and professional communication.</p>
